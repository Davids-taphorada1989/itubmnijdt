Just saw Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness and wow, my head’s spinning like a broken tattoo gun. Can’t really tell if it’s the   or the leftover popcorn stuck to my shoes. You know how when a drunk guy on the subway suddenly starts sobbing and there’s an unexpected poetic logic in his rambling? That. That’s what the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 felt like.

The opening scene? I swear I was having an existential crisis in my seat — felt like staring at my ink-stained hands expecting them to start talking. So murky but also a kind of raw beauty, like mixing too many colors in a tattoo and somehow ending with something incredible, next thing there's this grandma in a forest, knitting like the world's ending. My back's killing me now, seats were just leftover torture devices, I swear.

> Somewhere in the middle, when the characters were lost in that bizarre cityscape, I nearly forgot my name. Like, everyone searching for love but getting lost in their maps. Post-apocalyptic, but not like zombies — more like wandering through a tattoo shop during a blackout, just shadows and whispers and faint beeping from machines.

I remember someone wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , or was it the nightcrawler project I wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, whatever. The dialogue was all... kaleidoscopic? Kept bouncing in my head. People turning into trees, and… it made sense somehow. I could feel the guy next to me crunching on popcorn but it echoed like a whole avalanche; I was sinking, floating – that paradox of art or maybe just needing a nap, man, that cappuccino kept me awake, though.

There was this moment, near the end, when the light was a soft pulse — like after a long session under the needle, skin red, light vibrating through new patterns. It all faded together, like trying to print a dream, that's a mess but kind of memorable. Someone called, asking when they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   — guess everyone's going to want to relive that weird euphoria outside my mind.

I mean, not to spoil it but by the end, blank space felt louder than all noise...step outside, blinking at the ordinary world — incredible how art hits you in the gut or just feels like a drunken scribble on a napkin. Now, about that code thing or was it...

```c
int love = 0;
while (true) {
   if (darkness) {
      love = 1;
   }
   // darkness++;
   printf(%d
, love);
   break;
}
```
